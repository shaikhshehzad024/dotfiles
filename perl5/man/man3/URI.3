.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module implements the \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR class.  Objects of this class
represent "Uniform Resource Identifier references" as specified in RFC
2396 (and updated by RFC 2732).
.PP
A Uniform Resource Identifier is a compact string of characters that
identifies an abstract or physical resource.  A Uniform Resource
Identifier can be further classified as either a Uniform Resource Locator
(URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN).  The distinction between URL
and URN does not matter to the \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR class interface. A
"URI-reference" is a URI that may have additional information attached
in the form of a fragment identifier.
.PP
An absolute URI reference consists of three parts:  a \fIscheme\fR, a
\&\fIscheme-specific part\fR and a \fIfragment\fR identifier.  A subset of URI
references share a common syntax for hierarchical namespaces.  For
these, the scheme-specific part is further broken down into
\&\fIauthority\fR, \fIpath\fR and \fIquery\fR components.  These URIs can also
take the form of relative URI references, where the scheme (and
usually also the authority) component is missing, but implied by the
context of the URI reference.  The three forms of URI reference
syntax are summarized as follows:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&  <scheme>:<scheme\-specific\-part>#<fragment>
\&  <scheme>://<authority><path>?<query>#<fragment>
\&  <path>?<query>#<fragment>
.Ve
.PP
The components into which a URI reference can be divided depend on the
\&\fIscheme\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR class provides methods to get and set the
individual components.  The methods available for a specific
\&\f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR object depend on the scheme.
.SH CONSTRUCTORS
.IX Header "CONSTRUCTORS"
The following methods construct new \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR objects:
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI\->new( $str )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI\->new( \f(CW$str\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI->new( $str )"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI\->new( $str, $scheme )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI\->new( \f(CW$str\fR, \f(CW$scheme\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI->new( $str, $scheme )"
.PD
Constructs a new URI object.  The string
representation of a URI is given as argument, together with an optional
scheme specification.  Common URI wrappers like "" and <>, as well as
leading and trailing white space, are automatically removed from
the \f(CW$str\fR argument before it is processed further.
.Sp
The constructor determines the scheme, maps this to an appropriate
URI subclass, constructs a new object of that class and returns it.
.Sp
If the scheme isn't one of those that URI recognizes, you still get
an URI object back that you can access the generic methods on.  The
\&\f(CW\*(C`$uri\->has_recognized_scheme\*(C'\fR method can be used to test for
this.
.Sp
The \f(CW$scheme\fR argument is only used when \f(CW$str\fR is a
relative URI.  It can be either a simple string that
denotes the scheme, a string containing an absolute URI reference, or
an absolute \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR object.  If no \f(CW$scheme\fR is specified for a relative
URI \f(CW$str\fR, then \f(CW$str\fR is simply treated as a generic URI (no scheme-specific
methods available).
.Sp
The set of characters available for building URI references is
restricted (see URI::Escape).  Characters outside this set are
automatically escaped by the URI constructor.
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI\->new_abs( $str, $base_uri )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI\->new_abs( \f(CW$str\fR, \f(CW$base_uri\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI->new_abs( $str, $base_uri )"
Constructs a new absolute URI object.  The \f(CW$str\fR argument can
denote a relative or absolute URI.  If relative, then it is
absolutized using \f(CW$base_uri\fR as base. The \f(CW$base_uri\fR must be an absolute
URI.
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI::file\->new( $filename )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI::file\->new( \f(CW$filename\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI::file->new( $filename )"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI::file\->new( $filename, $os )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI::file\->new( \f(CW$filename\fR, \f(CW$os\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI::file->new( $filename, $os )"
.PD
Constructs a new \fIfile\fR URI from a file name.  See URI::file.
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI::file\->new_abs( $filename )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI::file\->new_abs( \f(CW$filename\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI::file->new_abs( $filename )"

.ie n .IP "$uri = URI::file\->new_abs( $filename, $os )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI::file\->new_abs( \f(CW$filename\fR, \f(CW$os\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI::file->new_abs( $filename, $os )"
.PD
Constructs a new absolute \fIfile\fR URI from a file name.  See
URI::file.
.ie n .IP "$uri = URI::file\->cwd" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR = URI::file\->cwd" 4
.IX Item "$uri = URI::file->cwd"
Returns the current working directory as a \fIfile\fR URI.  See
URI::file.
.ie n .IP $uri\->clone 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->clone 4
.IX Item "$uri->clone"
Returns a copy of the \f(CW$uri\fR.
.SH "COMMON METHODS"
.IX Header "COMMON METHODS"
The methods described in this section are available for all \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR
objects.
.PP
Methods that give access to components of a URI always return the
old value of the component.  The value returned is \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the
component was not present.  There is generally a difference between a
component that is empty (represented as \f(CW""\fR) and a component that is
missing (represented as \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR).  If an accessor method is given an
argument, it updates the corresponding component in addition to
returning the old value of the component.  Passing an undefined
argument removes the component (if possible).  The description of
each accessor method indicates whether the component is passed as
an escaped (percent-encoded) or an unescaped string.  A component that can be further
divided into sub-parts are usually passed escaped, as unescaping might
change its semantics.
.PP
The common methods available for all URI are:
.ie n .IP $uri\->scheme 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->scheme 4
.IX Item "$uri->scheme"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->scheme( $new_scheme )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->scheme( \f(CW$new_scheme\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->scheme( $new_scheme )"
.PD
Sets and returns the scheme part of the \f(CW$uri\fR.  If the \f(CW$uri\fR is
relative, then \f(CW$uri\fR\->scheme returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.  If called with an
argument, it updates the scheme of \f(CW$uri\fR, possibly changing the
class of \f(CW$uri\fR, and returns the old scheme value.  The method croaks
if the new scheme name is illegal; a scheme name must begin with a
letter and must consist of only US-ASCII letters, numbers, and a few
special marks: ".", "+", "\-".  This restriction effectively means
that the scheme must be passed unescaped.  Passing an undefined
argument to the scheme method makes the URI relative (if possible).
.Sp
Letter case does not matter for scheme names.  The string
returned by \f(CW$uri\fR\->scheme is always lowercase.  If you want the scheme
just as it was written in the URI in its original case,
you can use the \f(CW$uri\fR\->_scheme method instead.
.ie n .IP $uri\->has_recognized_scheme 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->has_recognized_scheme 4
.IX Item "$uri->has_recognized_scheme"
Returns TRUE if the URI scheme is one that URI recognizes.
.Sp
It will also be TRUE for relative URLs where a recognized
scheme was provided to the constructor, even if \f(CW\*(C`$uri\->scheme\*(C'\fR
returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR for these.
.ie n .IP $uri\->opaque 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->opaque 4
.IX Item "$uri->opaque"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->opaque( $new_opaque )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->opaque( \f(CW$new_opaque\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->opaque( $new_opaque )"
.PD
Sets and returns the scheme-specific part of the \f(CW$uri\fR
(everything between the scheme and the fragment)
as an escaped string.
.ie n .IP $uri\->path 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->path 4
.IX Item "$uri->path"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->path( $new_path )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->path( \f(CW$new_path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->path( $new_path )"
.PD
Sets and returns the same value as \f(CW$uri\fR\->opaque unless the URI
supports the generic syntax for hierarchical namespaces.
In that case the generic method is overridden to set and return
the part of the URI between the \fIhost name\fR and the \fIfragment\fR.
.ie n .IP $uri\->fragment 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->fragment 4
.IX Item "$uri->fragment"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->fragment( $new_frag )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->fragment( \f(CW$new_frag\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->fragment( $new_frag )"
.PD
Returns the fragment identifier of a URI reference
as an escaped string.
.ie n .IP $uri\->as_string 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->as_string 4
.IX Item "$uri->as_string"
Returns a URI object to a plain ASCII string.  URI objects are
also converted to plain strings automatically by overloading.  This
means that \f(CW$uri\fR objects can be used as plain strings in most Perl
constructs.
.ie n .IP $uri\->as_iri 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->as_iri 4
.IX Item "$uri->as_iri"
Returns a Unicode string representing the URI.  Escaped UTF\-8 sequences
representing non-ASCII characters are turned into their corresponding Unicode
code point.
.ie n .IP $uri\->canonical 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->canonical 4
.IX Item "$uri->canonical"
Returns a normalized version of the URI.  The rules
for normalization are scheme-dependent.  They usually involve
lowercasing the scheme and Internet host name components,
removing the explicit port specification if it matches the default port,
uppercasing all escape sequences, and unescaping octets that can be
better represented as plain characters.
.Sp
For efficiency reasons, if the \f(CW$uri\fR is already in normalized form,
then a reference to it is returned instead of a copy.
.ie n .IP "$uri\->eq( $other_uri )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->eq( \f(CW$other_uri\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->eq( $other_uri )"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "URI::eq( $first_uri, $other_uri )" 4
.el .IP "URI::eq( \f(CW$first_uri\fR, \f(CW$other_uri\fR )" 4
.IX Item "URI::eq( $first_uri, $other_uri )"
.PD
Tests whether two URI references are equal.  URI references
that normalize to the same string are considered equal.  The method
can also be used as a plain function which can also test two string
arguments.
.Sp
If you need to test whether two \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR object references denote the
same object, use the '==' operator.
.ie n .IP "$uri\->abs( $base_uri )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->abs( \f(CW$base_uri\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->abs( $base_uri )"
Returns an absolute URI reference.  If \f(CW$uri\fR is already
absolute, then a reference to it is simply returned.  If the \f(CW$uri\fR
is relative, then a new absolute URI is constructed by combining the
\&\f(CW$uri\fR and the \f(CW$base_uri\fR, and returned.
.ie n .IP "$uri\->rel( $base_uri )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->rel( \f(CW$base_uri\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->rel( $base_uri )"
Returns a relative URI reference if it is possible to
make one that denotes the same resource relative to \f(CW$base_uri\fR.
If not, then \f(CW$uri\fR is simply returned.
.ie n .IP $uri\->secure 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->secure 4
.IX Item "$uri->secure"
Returns a TRUE value if the URI is considered to point to a resource on
a secure channel, such as an SSL or TLS encrypted one.
.SH "GENERIC METHODS"
.IX Header "GENERIC METHODS"
The following methods are available to schemes that use the
common/generic syntax for hierarchical namespaces.  The descriptions of
schemes below indicate which these are.  Unrecognized schemes are
assumed to support the generic syntax, and therefore the following
methods:
.ie n .IP $uri\->authority 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->authority 4
.IX Item "$uri->authority"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->authority( $new_authority )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->authority( \f(CW$new_authority\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->authority( $new_authority )"
.PD
Sets and returns the escaped authority component
of the \f(CW$uri\fR.
.ie n .IP $uri\->path 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->path 4
.IX Item "$uri->path"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->path( $new_path )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->path( \f(CW$new_path\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->path( $new_path )"
.PD
Sets and returns the escaped path component of
the \f(CW$uri\fR (the part between the host name and the query or fragment).
The path can never be undefined, but it can be the empty string.
.ie n .IP $uri\->path_query 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->path_query 4
.IX Item "$uri->path_query"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->path_query( $new_path_query )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->path_query( \f(CW$new_path_query\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->path_query( $new_path_query )"
.PD
Sets and returns the escaped path and query
components as a single entity.  The path and the query are
separated by a "?" character, but the query can itself contain "?".
.ie n .IP $uri\->path_segments 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->path_segments 4
.IX Item "$uri->path_segments"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->path_segments( $segment, ... )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->path_segments( \f(CW$segment\fR, ... )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->path_segments( $segment, ... )"
.PD
Sets and returns the path.  In a scalar context, it returns
the same value as \f(CW$uri\fR\->path.  In a list context, it returns the
unescaped path segments that make up the path.  Path segments that
have parameters are returned as an anonymous array.  The first element
is the unescaped path segment proper;  subsequent elements are escaped
parameter strings.  Such an anonymous array uses overloading so it can
be treated as a string too, but this string does not include the
parameters.
.Sp
Note that absolute paths have the empty string as their first
\&\fIpath_segment\fR, i.e. the \fIpath\fR \f(CW\*(C`/foo/bar\*(C'\fR have 3
\&\fIpath_segments\fR; "", "foo" and "bar".
.ie n .IP $uri\->query 4

.PD
Sets and returns the escaped query component of
the \f(CW$uri\fR.

.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->query_form( \e%hash, \f(CW$delim\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->query_form( %hash, $delim )"
.PD
Sets and returns query components that use the
\&\fIapplication/x\-www\-form\-urlencoded\fR format.  Key/value pairs are
separated by "&", and the key is separated from the value by a "="
character.
.Sp
The form can be set either by passing separate key/value pairs, or via
an array or hash reference.  Passing an empty array or an empty hash
removes the query component, whereas passing no arguments at all leaves
the component unchanged.  The order of keys is undefined if a hash
reference is passed.  The old value is always returned as a list of
separate key/value pairs.  Assigning this list to a hash is unwise as
the keys returned might repeat.
.Sp
The values passed when setting the form can be plain strings or
references to arrays of strings.  Passing an array of values has the
same effect as passing the key repeatedly with one value at a time.
All the following statements have the same effect:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    $uri\->query_form(foo => 1, foo => 2);
\&    $uri\->query_form(foo => [1, 2]);
\&    $uri\->query_form([ foo => 1, foo => 2 ]);
\&    $uri\->query_form([ foo => [1, 2] ]);
\&    $uri\->query_form({ foo => [1, 2] });
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW$delim\fR parameter can be passed as ";" to force the key/value pairs
to be delimited by ";" instead of "&" in the query string.  This
practice is often recommended for URLs embedded in HTML or XML
documents as this avoids the trouble of escaping the "&" character.
You might also set the \f(CW$URI::DEFAULT_QUERY_FORM_DELIMITER\fR variable to
";" for the same global effect.

.PD
If \f(CW$u\fR\->query_param is called with no arguments, it returns all the
distinct parameter keys of the URI.  In a scalar context it returns the
number of distinct keys.
.Sp
When a \f(CW$key\fR argument is given, the method returns the parameter values with the
given key.  In a scalar context, only the first parameter value is
returned.
.Sp
If additional arguments are given, they are used to update successive
parameters with the given key.  If any of the values provided are
array references, then the array is dereferenced to get the actual
values.
.Sp
Please note that you can supply multiple values to this method, but you cannot
supply multiple keys.
.Sp
Do this:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
Do NOT do this:

Adds new parameters with the given

One difference is that this expression would return the old values

Deletes all key/value pairs with the given key.
The old values are returned.  In a scalar context, only the first value
is returned.
.Sp
Using the \fBquery_param_delete()\fR method is slightly more efficient than
the equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $u\->query_param($key, []);
.Ve
.ie n .IP "$hashref = $u\->query_form_hash" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$hashref\fR = \f(CW$u\fR\->query_form_hash" 4
.IX Item "$hashref = $u->query_form_hash"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$u\->query_form_hash( \e%new_form )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$u\fR\->query_form_hash( \e%new_form )" 4
.IX Item "$u->query_form_hash( %new_form )"
.PD
Returns a reference to a hash that represents the
query form's key/value pairs.  If a key occurs multiple times, then the hash
value becomes an array reference.
.Sp
Note that sequence information is lost.  This means that:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   $u\->query_form_hash($u\->query_form_hash);
.Ve
.Sp
is not necessarily a no-op, as it may reorder the key/value pairs.
The values returned by the \fBquery_param()\fR method should stay the same
though.
.ie n .IP $uri\->query_keywords 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->query_keywords 4
.IX Item "$uri->query_keywords"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->query_keywords( $keywords, ... )" 4

.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->query_keywords( \e@keywords )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->query_keywords( @keywords )"
.PD
Sets and returns query components that use the
keywords separated by "+" format.
.Sp
The keywords can be set either by passing separate keywords directly
or by passing a reference to an array of keywords.  Passing an empty
array removes the query component, whereas passing no arguments at
all leaves the component unchanged.  The old value is always returned
as a list of separate words.
.SH "SERVER METHODS"
.IX Header "SERVER METHODS"
For schemes where the \fIauthority\fR component denotes an Internet host,
the following methods are available in addition to the generic
methods.
.ie n .IP $uri\->userinfo 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->userinfo 4
.IX Item "$uri->userinfo"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->userinfo( $new_userinfo )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->userinfo( \f(CW$new_userinfo\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->userinfo( $new_userinfo )"
.PD
Sets and returns the escaped userinfo part of the
authority component.
.Sp
For some schemes this is a user name and a password separated by
a colon.  This practice is not recommended. Embedding passwords in
clear text (such as URI) has proven to be a security risk in almost
every case where it has been used.
.ie n .IP $uri\->host 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->host 4
.IX Item "$uri->host"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->host( $new_host )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->host( \f(CW$new_host\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->host( $new_host )"
.PD
Sets and returns the unescaped hostname.
.Sp
If the \f(CW$new_host\fR string ends with a colon and a number, then this
number also sets the port.
.Sp
For IPv6 addresses the brackets around the raw address is removed in the return
value from \f(CW$uri\fR\->host.  When setting the host attribute to an IPv6 address you
can use a raw address or one enclosed in brackets.  The address needs to be
enclosed in brackets if you want to pass in a new port value as well.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $uri = URI\->new("http://www.\exC3\exBCri\-sample/foo/bar.html");
\&  print $u\->host; # www.xn\-\-ri\-sample\-fra0f
.Ve
.ie n .IP $uri\->ihost 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->ihost 4
.IX Item "$uri->ihost"
Returns the host in Unicode form. Any IDNA A\-labels (encoded unicode chars with
\&\fIxn\-\-\fR prefix) are turned into U\-labels (unicode chars).
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $uri = URI\->new("http://www.\exC3\exBCri\-sample/foo/bar.html");
\&  print $u\->ihost; # www.\exC3\exBCri\-sample
.Ve
.ie n .IP $uri\->port 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->port 4
.IX Item "$uri->port"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->port( $new_port )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->port( \f(CW$new_port\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->port( $new_port )"
.PD
Sets and returns the port.  The port is a simple integer
that should be greater than 0.
.Sp
If a port is not specified explicitly in the URI, then the URI scheme's default port
is returned. If you don't want the default port
substituted, then you can use the \f(CW$uri\fR\->_port method instead.
.ie n .IP $uri\->host_port 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->host_port 4
.IX Item "$uri->host_port"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP "$uri\->host_port( $new_host_port )" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$uri\fR\->host_port( \f(CW$new_host_port\fR )" 4
.IX Item "$uri->host_port( $new_host_port )"
.PD
Sets and returns the host and port as a single
unit.  The returned value includes a port, even if it matches the
default port.  The host part and the port part are separated by a
colon: ":".
.Sp
For IPv6 addresses the bracketing is preserved; thus
URI\->new("http://[::1]/")\->host_port returns "[::1]:80".  Contrast this with
\&\f(CW$uri\fR\->host which will remove the brackets.
.ie n .IP $uri\->default_port 4
.el .IP \f(CW$uri\fR\->default_port 4
.IX Item "$uri->default_port"
Returns the default port of the URI scheme to which \f(CW$uri\fR
belongs.  For \fIhttp\fR this is the number 80, for \fIftp\fR this
is the number 21, etc.  The default port for a scheme can not be
changed.
.SH "SCHEME-SPECIFIC SUPPORT"
.IX Header "SCHEME-SPECIFIC SUPPORT"
Scheme-specific support is provided for the following URI schemes.  For \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR

URI::ldap for details.
.IP \fBldapi\fR: 4
.IX Item "ldapi:"
Like the \fIldap\fR URI scheme, but uses a UNIX domain socket.  The
server methods are not supported, and the local socket path is
available as \f(CW$uri\fR\->un_path.  The \fIldapi\fR scheme is used by the
OpenLDAP package.  There is no real specification for it, but it is
mentioned in various OpenLDAP manual pages.
.IP \fBldaps\fR: 4
.IX Item "ldaps:"

mechanism.
.IP \fBmailto\fR: 4
.IX Item "mailto:"
The \fImailto\fR URI scheme is specified in RFC 2368.  The scheme was
originally used to designate the Internet mailing address of an

objects belonging to the urn scheme provide the common methods, and also the
methods \f(CW$uri\fR\->nid and \f(CW$uri\fR\->nss, which return the Namespace Identifier
and the Namespace-Specific String respectively.
.Sp
The Namespace Identifier basically works like the Scheme identifier of
URIs, and further divides the URN namespace.  Namespace Identifier
assignments are maintained at
<http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn\-namespaces>.
.Sp
Letter case is not significant for the Namespace Identifier.  It is
always returned in lower case by the \f(CW$uri\fR\->nid method.  The \f(CW$uri\fR\->_nid
method can be used if you want it in its original case.

The \f(CW\*(C`urn:isbn:\*(C'\fR namespace contains International Standard Book
Numbers (ISBNs) and is described in RFC 3187.  A \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR object belonging
to this namespace has the following extra methods (if the
Business::ISBN module is available): \f(CW$uri\fR\->isbn,
\&\f(CW$uri\fR\->isbn_publisher_code, \f(CW$uri\fR\->isbn_group_code (formerly isbn_country_code,
which is still supported by issues a deprecation warning), \f(CW$uri\fR\->isbn_as_ean.

.IX Item "urn:oid:"
The \f(CW\*(C`urn:oid:\*(C'\fR namespace contains Object Identifiers (OIDs) and is
described in RFC 3061.  An object identifier consists of sequences of digits
separated by dots.  A \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR object belonging to this namespace has an
additional method called \f(CW$uri\fR\->oid that can be used to get/set the oid
value.  In a list context, oid numbers are returned as separate elements.
.SH "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION VARIABLES"
The following configuration variables influence how the class and its
methods behave:
.ie n .IP $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME 4
.el .IP \f(CW$URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME\fR 4
.IX Item "$URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME"
Some older parsers used to allow the scheme name to be present in the
relative URL if it was the same as the base URL scheme.  RFC 2396 says
that this should be avoided, but you can enable this old behaviour by
setting the \f(CW$URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME\fR variable to a TRUE value.
The difference is demonstrated by the following examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  URI\->new("http:foo")\->abs("http://host/a/b")
\&      ==>  "http:foo"
\&
\&  local $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME = 1;

.ie n .IP $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS 4
.el .IP \f(CW$URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS\fR 4
.IX Item "$URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS"
You can also have the \fBabs()\fR method ignore excess ".."
segments in the relative URI by setting \f(CW$URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS\fR
to a TRUE value.  The difference is demonstrated by the following
examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2

\&      ==> "http://host/../../foo"
\&
\&  local $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS = 1;

.ie n .IP $URI::DEFAULT_QUERY_FORM_DELIMITER 4
.el .IP \f(CW$URI::DEFAULT_QUERY_FORM_DELIMITER\fR 4
.IX Item "$URI::DEFAULT_QUERY_FORM_DELIMITER"

delimited by ";" instead of "&" which is the default.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IP URI_HAS_RESERVED_SQUARE_BRACKETS 4
.IX Item "URI_HAS_RESERVED_SQUARE_BRACKETS"
Before version 5.11, URI treated square brackets as reserved characters
throughout the whole URI string. However, these brackets are reserved
only within the authority/host part of the URI and nowhere else (RFC 3986).
.Sp
Starting with version 5.11, URI takes this distinction into account.
Setting the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`URI_HAS_RESERVED_SQUARE_BRACKETS\*(C'\fR
(programmatically or via the shell), restores the old behavior.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  #\-\- restore 5.10 behavior programmatically
\&  BEGIN {

\&  }
\&  use URI ();

.Sp
\&\fINote\fR: This environment variable is just used during initialization and has to be set
      \fIbefore\fR module URI is used/required. Changing it at run time has no effect.
.Sp
Its value can be checked programmatically by accessing the constant
\&\f(CW\*(C`URI::HAS_RESERVED_SQUARE_BRACKETS\*(C'\fR.
.SH BUGS
.IX Header "BUGS"
There are some things that are not quite right:
.IP \(bu 4
Using regexp variables like \f(CW$1\fR directly as arguments to the URI accessor methods
does not work too well with current perl implementations.  I would argue
that this is actually a bug in perl.  The workaround is to quote
them. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   /(...)/ || die;
\&   $u\->query("$1");
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
The escaping (percent encoding) of chars in the 128 .. 255 range passed to the
URI constructor or when setting URI parts using the accessor methods depend on
the state of the internal UTF8 flag (see utf8::is_utf8) of the string passed.
If the UTF8 flag is set the UTF\-8 encoded version of the character is percent
encoded.  If the UTF8 flag isn't set the Latin\-1 version (byte) of the
character is percent encoded.  This basically exposes the internal encoding of
Perl strings.
.SH "PARSING URIs WITH REGEXP"
.IX Header "PARSING URIs WITH REGEXP"
