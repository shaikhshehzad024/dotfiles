.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides functions that expand strings into real absolute
URIs using some built-in heuristics.  Strings that already represent
absolute URIs (i.e. that start with a \f(CW\*(C`scheme:\*(C'\fR part) are never modified
and are returned unchanged.  The main use of these functions is to
allow abbreviated URIs similar to what many web browsers allow for URIs
typed in by the user.
.PP
The following functions are provided:
.IP uf_uristr($str) 4
.IX Item "uf_uristr($str)"
Tries to make the argument string
into a proper absolute URI string.  The "uf_" prefix stands for "User 
Friendly".  Under MacOS, it assumes that any string with a common URL 
scheme (http, ftp, etc.) is a URL rather than a local path.  So don't name 
your volumes after common URL schemes and expect \fBuf_uristr()\fR to construct 
valid file: URL's on those volumes for you, because it won't.
.IP uf_uri($str) 4
.IX Item "uf_uri($str)"
Works the same way as \fBuf_uristr()\fR but
returns a \f(CW\*(C`URI\*(C'\fR object.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
If the hostname portion of a URI does not contain any dots, then
certain qualified guesses are made.  These guesses are governed by
the following environment variables:
.IP COUNTRY 10
.IX Item "COUNTRY"
The two-letter country code (ISO 3166) for your location.  If
the domain name of your host ends with two letters, then it is taken
to be the default country. See also Locale::Country.
.IP "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LANG" 10
.IX Item "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LANG"
If COUNTRY is not set, these standard environment variables are
examined and country (not language) information possibly found in them
is used as the default country.
.IP URL_GUESS_PATTERN 10
.IX Item "URL_GUESS_PATTERN"
Contains a space-separated list of URL patterns to try.  The string
"ACME" is for some reason used as a placeholder for the host name in
the URL provided.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& URL_GUESS_PATTERN="www.ACME.no www.ACME.se www.ACME.com"
\& export URL_GUESS_PATTERN
.Ve
.Sp
Specifying URL_GUESS_PATTERN disables any guessing rules based on
country.  An empty URL_GUESS_PATTERN disables any guessing that
involves host name lookups.
